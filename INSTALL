Install instructions
====================

It is advised to install all the packages needed to run Wikipedia-tags-in-OSM in a virtualenv
(see below for more information).

First of all, let's create a new virtualenv:
```bash
mkvirtualenv wtosm
```

For all the installation operations activate your virtualenv with:
```bash
workon wtosm
```
you prompt will change to reflect the fact that you are using a virtualenv to something like:
`(wtosm)user@host:~/wikipedia-tags-in-osm$`

In general you can use install the package needed using the requirements file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To exit the virtualenv you can `deactivate' it:
```bash
deactivate

There are several details that need to be taken care of and are detailed below.

Installing Spatialite tools 
---------------------------
The tool `spatialite_osm_raw` of the [spatialite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/), you can download
and install it from the [spatialite-tools](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/spatialite-tools/index)
page.

On a Debian/Ubuntu system you can install with:
```bash
sudo apt-get install spatialite-bin libspatialite-dev
```

Installing lxml
---------------
To install the python `lxml` package you need some library headers for libxml2 and libxslt,

On a Debian (and derived) system you can install them with the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
```

After installing this libraries you can install the module `lxml` with pip:
```bash
pip install lxml
```
Otherwise you can install the lxml module system-wide installing the package
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-lxml
```

Install pysqlite
----------------

Installing the pysqlite2 module for pythin requires a little bit extra work because
the `enable_load_extension` attribute is [disabled by default](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1545479/force-python-to-forego-native-sqlite3-and-use-the-installed-latest-sqlite3-ver).

To install the sqlite-relate packages you need the libsqlite3 headers.
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
```

Download the pysqlite package (as of now ver. 2.6.3) from PyPI: [pysqlite[(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysqlite),
and extract the package:
```bash
wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pysqlite/pysqlite-2.6.3.tar.gz#md5=7ff1cedee74646b50117acff87aa1cfa
tar xvzf pysqlite-2.6.3.tar.gz
```

Open the `setup.cfg` file and comment out the setting that omits the load extension attribute to be installed.
Add an hash at the beginning of the line as in:
`#define=SQLITE_OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION`

Then install the package using `setup.py`:
```bash
(wtosmapp)user@host:~/wtosm/misc/pysqlite-2.6.3$ python setup.py install
```
(make sure that you are working on your virtualenv before isntalling)

About virtualenvs
-----------------

If you wish to know more about virtualenvs you can read some info in this 
[primer](http://iamzed.com/2009/05/07/a-primer-on-virtualenv/).

An easy way to install a working virtual + virtualenvwrapper is

Removing virtualenvs
--------------------

You can remove the virtualenv with the command `rmvirtualenv`
```bash
